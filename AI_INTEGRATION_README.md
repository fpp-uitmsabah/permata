## 🎭 The Story

### What You Reported
> "My AI integration is not working. It fails to fetch and doesn't work properly."

### What I Found
Your AI integration has a **response format mismatch**:

```javascript
// What Apps Script sends:
{
  summary: "Expert in Finance...",
  analysis: "Detailed analysis with markdown..."
}

// What Frontend expects:
{
  text: "## Strengths:\n- Expert in Finance..."
}
```

The frontend looks for `result.text`, doesn't find it, and throws "Invalid response format" error.

### The Fix
Change ONE line in your Google Apps Script:

```javascript
// Instead of:
responseObject = { summary: summary, analysis: analysis };

// Use:
responseObject = { text: generatedText };
```

That's it! 🎉

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake #1: Only Saving, Not Deploying
**Wrong**: File → Save → Close  
**Right**: File → Save → Deploy → New Version

### ❌ Mistake #2: Not Clearing Browser Cache
**Wrong**: Deploy → Test immediately  
**Right**: Deploy → Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) → Test

### ❌ Mistake #3: Wrong Deployment Settings
**Wrong**: "Who has access" = "Only myself"  
**Right**: "Who has access" = "Anyone"

### ❌ Mistake #4: Modifying Frontend Only
**Wrong**: Changing frontend to use `data.summary`  
**Right**: Changing Apps Script to return `{text}`
