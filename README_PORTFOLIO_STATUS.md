# Portfolio Pages Status Report

## Summary for the User

Dear User,

I understand your concern about the portfolio pages. You mentioned that you were worried only "fauzi" (Ahmad Fauze) or "poji.html" was updated, and other portfolio pages might be missing.

**I'm happy to report: ALL 54 PORTFOLIO PAGES ARE PRESENT AND WORKING! ✅**

## What I Found

After conducting a comprehensive verification, here's what I discovered:

### ✅ Complete Portfolio Coverage
- **54 faculty members** are listed in the directory (index.html)
- **54 portfolio HTML files** exist in the repository
- **0 missing files** - every single portfolio page is present
- **0 broken links** - all links in index.html work correctly

### ✅ All Portfolio Pages Verified

Every faculty member has their portfolio page available:

1. Ahmad Fauze Abdul Hamit → **poji.html** (88KB) ✓
2. Associate Professor Dr Rozita@Uji Mohammed → **rozita.html** (58KB) ✓
3. Profesor Ts. Dr. Imbarine Bin Hj Bujang → **imbarine.html** (65KB) ✓
4. Associate Professor Dr Sylvia @ Nabila Azwa Ambad → **nabila.html** (52KB) ✓
5. Associate Professor Dr Imelda Albert Gisip → **imelda.html** (42KB) ✓

...and **49 more** portfolio pages (see PORTFOLIO_VERIFICATION_SUMMARY.md for complete list)

## Special Note About Ahmad Fauze

Ahmad Fauze actually has **TWO** portfolio files:
- **poji.html** (87,991 bytes) - The comprehensive primary portfolio (currently linked in index.html)
- **fauze.html** (39,933 bytes) - An alternative portfolio

Both files exist and are valid. The index.html currently points to poji.html.

## What This Means
